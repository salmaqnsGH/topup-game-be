# Topup Game Admin Web App & API

This Node.js backend project supports a top-up game app and its admin dashboard. It uses Express for routing and middleware, JWT for authentication and authorization, and integrates with MongoDB to store user and game data. The project includes APIs for user auth, game transactions, leaderboard, and the admin dashboard for game management and statistics. Users can top-up their game account and track their progress through the leaderboard, providing a secure and seamless gaming experience.
